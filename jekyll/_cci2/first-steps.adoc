= Sign up and try CircleCI

:page-description: First step for using CircleCI.
:icons: font
:experimental:

To start building on CircleCI, go to the link:https://circleci.com/signup/[Sign Up] page and create an account or follow an email invite link from your team. After signing up you can create an organization or find your teammates.

[NOTE]
====
CircleCI supports GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab projects.

If you use **GitHub** or **GitLab**, and are creating a CircleCI organization for your team, you will set the version control system (VCS) integration type, and authenticate with your VCS provider during the signup process. Team members that you invite to your CircleCI org can join without authenticating with your VCS. However, if they are to create new projects, they will authenticate during the project creation process.

If you use **Bitbucket**, every team member signing up for a new account and joining your org will authenticate with Bitbucket _during_ the signup process.
====

== Sign up

From the link:https://circleci.com/signup/[Sign Up] page, do one of the following:

=== Building GitHub and GitLab projects?

If you want to build mainly **GitHub** or **GitLab** projects, sign up with your email address to create an account.

TIP: If you want to collaborate on an existing org you can request an invitation now and use an invite link to signup, or you can create an account and request an invite later.

. Select btn:[Sign Up].
. Enter your email address and create a password.
. Answer a few questions about how you plan to use CircleCI.
. You can now choose one of the following:
** Use the xref:invite-your-team#[Find Your Team] option to connect your account to a shared org
** <<sign-up-and-create-an-org>>

=== Building Bitbucket projects?

If you want to primarily build **Bitbucket** projects, sign up with your Bitbucket account. After you connect your Bitbucket account you can go ahead and start setting up projects, following the xref:create-project#set-up-a-project[Create a project in CircleCI] page. Your org in CircleCI maps directly to your Bitbucket workspace.

. Select btn:[Sign Up With Bitbucket].
. Log in to your Bitbucket account
. Enter your email address and create a password.

. Choose between creating an organization or joining your teammates in an existing org:
** If you are **creating a new CircleCI org** for your team, follow the <<sign-up-and-create-an-org>> steps below.
** If you want to join an existing shared organization, follow the steps on the xref:#invite-your-team[Join your teammates] page.

[#sign-up-and-create-an-org]
== Create an org

This section covers creating a new CircleCI organization. A CircleCI organization may correspond directly to a _personal_ CircleCI account, or more commonly, to a _shared_ account. Shared orgs are where teams collaborate. Multiple collaborating team members' personal CircleCI accounts can be associated with a shared org.

. From your user homepage Select btn:[Get Started] in the "Start a new organization" card.

. Give your organization a name and select btn:[Let's Go].

. Create a project to get started. Select **Get Started** in the "Create a project" card, and refer to the xref:create-project#create-a-project[Create a project] page for further steps.

[TIP]
====
If you choose not to connect your code at this time, you can still explore some example projects within the CircleCI app.

* You can take a look at a popular open source project building on CircleCI (link:https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/facebook/react[React by Facebook])
* Or some of our own sample projects: a link:https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/CircleCI-Public/sample-javascript-cfd/[sample JavaScript app], and a link:https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/CircleCI-Public/sample-python-cfd/[sample Python app].
====

. Invite your team from menu:Organization Settings[People]. For more information on inviting people to your org, see the xref:invite-your-team#invite-teammates[Join your teammates] page.


Select the VCS where your code is stored, GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket.

[#sign-up-with-an-invite]
== Sign up with an invite

If you are signing up using an invite from a team member, you will be _joining_ a CircleCI organization. The CircleCI organization is a _shared_ account where a team collaborates, and with which multiple team members' personal CircleCI accounts can be associated.


. To create an account for free with CircleCI, follow the link in your invite email and enter your email address and password.

. On the next screen, respond to prompts that best describe your role and your engineering organization.

. Finally, you will be taken to your organization's pipelines dashboard in the CircleCI web app. From here, you can follow projects or trigger pipelines in projects to which you have access in your organization, or set up new projects.

Note that if you are setting up a project for the first time, you may need to authenticate with your VCS provider. Once you have completed a one-time authentication, you will be able to set up subsequent projects in CircleCI more quickly. Refer to the xref:create-project#[Creating a Project] guide for more information.

Guides for integrating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab projects are available as follows:

- xref:github-apps-integration#[GitHub App integration]
- xref:github-integration#[GitHub OAuth app integration]
- xref:bitbucket-integration#[Bitbucket integration]
- xref:gitlab-integration#[GitLab integration]
