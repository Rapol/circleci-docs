Runner benchmarks are intended to show the performance tradeoffs of runner up to non-acceptable error threshold. From the below chart you can see there is a trade off in replicaset, concurrency, tasks, queue and run times. Depending on the type of workloads your teams run (high parallelism, fan-in/out) you may need to adjust your cluster for high concurrency and tasks, potentially impacting queuing, runtime and other factors. 

By publishing our benchmarks we are able to make measurable improvements to the performance and scale of runner, and show the impact of those improvements. 

NOTE: Benchmarks were performed on GKE (google) cluster with 5 dedicated E2-medium nodes using the cos_containerd image with no autoscaling and GKE version 1.29.4.

[#Runner Configuration Recommendations]
== Runner Configuration Recommendations
Based on the reference architecture of GKE 1.29.4 using a node pool of 5 E2 medium nodes, and the above benchmarks several recommendations for container runner cluster configurations can be made, using the replica count of the container agent, and maximum concurrent task configurations. 

[#High Performance Cluster]
== High Performance Cluster
* 3 replicas of container agent
* 80 concurrent tasks per replica. 

This configuration makes a slight trade off of stability, a slightly higher rate of infrastructure failures, to achieve much higher task throughput and to reduce queueing times. 

[#High Stability Cluster]
== High Stability Cluster
* 1 replica of container agent
* 20 concurrent tasks per replica

This configuration trades off throughput for higher stability, with minimal infrastructure failures. This is the default configuration for the container agent helm chart. 

When tuning a cluster for performance there are three main variables to consider: container agent replica count, maximum concurrent tasks per replica, and node pool configuration. 

[#Container Agent Replica Count]
== Container Agent Replica Count
The more replicas of container agent, the faster tasks will get claimed as each replica runs its own collection of claiming loops. This benefits users who have sudden large backlogs of tasks to run, as tasks will be able to be claimed more quickly, and have a pod spec submitted to the Kubernetes cluster for scheduling. It is worth considering that the more replicas used (and more tasks that are able to launch concurrently) the greater the strain on the K8s control plane, and the more prone you'll be to task start failures. CircleCI container runners will attempt to reschedule a task up to three times before declaring it as an infrastructure failure. 

[#Maximum Concurrent Tasks per Replica]
== Maximum Concurrent Tasks per Replica
This number in particular is very sensitive to node types and counts. The more tasks that are attempted to launch in a short window the higher the strain on the Kubernetes clusterâ€™s control plane, as well as the individual kubelets which are responsible for the pods and containers on a specific node. As node power and count increase the impact of concurrent tasks on a cluster decreases. The lower the number of maximum concurrent tasks, the greater the reliability of tasks successfully starting and not experiencing an infrastructure failure. 

As node count and resources increase - particularly in terms of CPU - the less likely an infrastructure failure will occur for the task. 

[#Node Types and Count]
== Node Types and Count
The above recommendations were made based on the reference cluster configuration. As a node pool grows, or is set to a higher resource based instance type, the more reliably tasks will execute. When sizing a cluster it is recommended that some headspace is added beyond what is expected for individual tasks to require. The kubelet and container driver share the same resources as the pods on the node, and the more resource starved they become the more prone to long queue times and infrastructure failures tasks become. The more distributed pods are able to be scheduled the less pressure and backlog are applied to the individual kubelets and container engines, resulting in shorter queueing times.
