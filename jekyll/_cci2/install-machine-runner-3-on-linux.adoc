If you are unable to use the prebuilt packages to install your self-hosted runner the manual installation process may be used.

CAUTION: We recommend installing and using machine runner 3.0 with the Linux packages on Linux.

WARNING: If you follow the manual installation method, CricleCI machine runner 3.0 will not update or start automatically.

The job will then execute using your self-hosted runner when you push the `.circleci/config.yml` to your VCS provider.
